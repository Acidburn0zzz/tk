.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsysnotify\fP \fItitle\fP? \fImessage\fR?

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBsysnotify\fP command creates a platform-specific system notification alert. Its intent is to provide a brief, unobtrusive notification to the user by popping up a window that briefly appears in a corner of the screen.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Here is an example of the \fBsysnotify\fP code:
.CS
    sysnotify "Alert" "This is just a test of the Tk System Notification Code."
.CE
.SH PLATFORM NOTES
.PP
The macOS and Windows versions are native implmentations using system 
API's. The X11 version has a conditional dependency on libnotify, and 
falls back to a Tcl-only implementation if libnotify is not installed. 
.SH KEYWORDS
notify, alert
